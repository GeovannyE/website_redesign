<center><h1>Adore-A-Bull Rescue Inc.,</h1>
    <h2>A Voice for the Voiceless</h2></center>
    
     <p>Our Mission: Our mission to save pit bulls begins with rescue of the neglected, abused, and misunderstood.  Through our caring fosters we nurture and rehabilitate.  Through our voice we educate and change minds. Through our work we match companions to families.  Our mission will never end.<br /> 
    
    Adore-A-Bull Rescue (AABR) was founded in 2010 by a small group of individuals dedicated to the rescue and rehabilitation of the American Pit Bull Terrier.  With limited resources and few homes to foster our dogs, AABR started with only 2-3 dogs in the rescue at a time.  Over the years AABR has grown into a large network of volunteers, foster homes, and advocates working to save and rehabilitate bully breed dogs in the Greater Cincinnati Area.  Today AABR fosters approximately 20-30 dogs and puppies at any given time.<br /><br /><br />
    
    Since our inception, AABR has positively impacted the Cincinnati community in a number of ways. Our mission does not simply include saving the lives of abused, abandoned, and neglected pit bulls. It also encompasses the importance of breed education and responsible pet parenting, in an effort to help the public understand the specific needs of the pit bull terrier. Our goal to change minds and reverse the negative stereotype of the pit bull is predominant in what we do.  If we are to make a difference, we must look past placing as many dogs as possible, and instead focus on the quality of our adoptions and educational outreach.<br /><br /><br />
    
    Adore-A-Bull has also been a leading voice in ending breed specific legislation (BSL) in Cincinnati in 2011, as well as surrounding communities since then.<br />
    
    Since our inception, we have saved approximately 900 dogs in the Cincinnati community. We enjoy wonderful working relationships with a number of local shelters and businesses. We look forward to saving many more lives of our pit bull friends, and continuing to have a positive impact on the way our community views this most misunderstood breed.<br /></p>
